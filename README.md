# Big Data Analysis Project on Formula 1  

This repository holds a research project that investigates the correlation between Qualifaction times and the final grid position obtained by a driver over a Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend 

## Research Questions 

1. Determines wether changes to the car ave a direct impact on faster lap times for the following year
2. Use driver performance data to try and predict a drivers final position based on their position in qualifying 

## Dataset
